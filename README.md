# Crud-App-MEAN
A simple contact book style CRUD app using MEAN stack. Based on this tutorial series https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iFsYJG3fGro

To run this app, you may clone and run `$ node server` from the directory which has `server.js`

You also need to set up your Mongo DB. Feel free to change the DB connection URL in the `server.js` file.
